<p>
    A delicious runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating these.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons bacon grease</li>
    <li>1 slice bread</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Melt the bacon grease in a non-stick pan over low heat.
    </li>
    <li>Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice; lay in the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm. Flip again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately.
